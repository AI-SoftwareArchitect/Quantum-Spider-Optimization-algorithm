# Quantum Spider Optimization Algorithm (QSOA)

>  A novel quantum-inspired, bio-quantum hybrid optimizer inspired by spider web behavior and qubit superposition.

---

## Overview

Quantum Spider Optimization Algorithm (QSOA) is a unique metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by:

-  **Spiders' prey-catching strategies on their webs**
-  **Quantum superposition and measurement principles from quantum computing**

Each agent (spider) maintains a **quantum amplitude** per dimension, representing a superposition of possible positions. These amplitudes are **measured** to produce actual candidate solutions. The spiders update their amplitudes based on global best influence and random neighbor entanglement, resulting in a strong balance between **exploration** and **exploitation**.

## ðŸ§  Inspirations

- **Nature**: Spider webs vibrate upon prey contact. Spiders detect vibration intensity and direction to localize and optimize their movement.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Agents operate in superposed states like qubits. Measurement collapses the state into a concrete position. Updates are inspired by quantum interference and entanglement.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Fully implemented in Java â€” no dependencies
- âœ… Uses real-valued quantum amplitude encoding
- âœ… Hybrid local-global update inspired by quantum entanglement
- âœ… Easy to adapt for custom objective functions
- âœ… Great performance on continuous optimization problems (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin)

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Initialization**:  
   Each spider is initialized with a quantum amplitude vector `[0, 1]`.

2. **Measurement**:  
   Using the quantum amplitude, the spider's position is computed as:
   ```java
   position = lowerBound + amplitude * (upperBound - lowerBound);
